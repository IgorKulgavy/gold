## General Information
- Task: Predict the concentration of gold during the gold purification process.
- The purpose of the project: Using historical data, build a machine learning model predicting the concentration of gold in the ore after cleaning.
- The model will help optimize production so as not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.



## Technologies Used
- Pandas - version 1.3.5
- Numpy - version 1.21.6
- Sklearn - version 1.0.2
- Matplotlib - version 3.2.2


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ 

## Room for Improvement

To do:
- Testing another ML models.
- Data analysis for the possibility of creating new features, identifying relationships between different stages of cleaning.
